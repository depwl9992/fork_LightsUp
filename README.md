# fork_LightsUp
Fork of the Sourceforge project Lights Up! by Terbos for unbuffered DMX control

Check out the original project at https://sourceforge.net/projects/lightsup/.

Do note: I am not the original author. Just a curious electronics tech trying to find sources of the DMX protocol over RS-485. My plan is to springboard off of this project to design something myself with my own featureset. After all, https://xkcd.com/927/.
