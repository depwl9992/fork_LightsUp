# fork_LightsUp
Fork of the project Lights Up! by Terry Wells (Terbos) on Sourceforge for unbuffered DMX control

Check out the original at https://sourceforge.net/projects/lightsup/.

Do note: I am not the original author. Just a curious electronics tech trying to find sources of the DMX protocol over RS-485. My plan is to springboard off of this project to design something myself with my own featureset. After all, https://xkcd.com/927/. I have every intention of modifying and redistributing this project per the license agreement of GPLv2 which Mr. Wells has given his project on Sourceforge. If my compliance is in error, do let me know!
